# BC|OS

Hutch uses BC|OS as an [ðŸ’”Activity Source](#)

The primary source of documentation for the BC|OS REST API v2 should be the service's [OpenAPI (Swagger) spec](bcos/open-api).

Provided here is some supporting documentation to supplement the BC|OS OpenAPI spec:

- [Endpoint schema details](bcos/endpoint-schema) not currently provided in the OpenAPI spec
  - details of both request and response payloads for endpoints used by Hutch
- Specific guidance for [usage in Hutch](bcos/hutch-usage)

:::info
Hutch 1.x+ uses the newer **Tasks** API

The original proof-of-concept used the now deprecated **Connector** API from the REST API v1.
