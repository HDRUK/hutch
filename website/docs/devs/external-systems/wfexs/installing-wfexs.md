# Installing WfExS

## System requirements
It is recommended to use WfExS on Ubuntu. Use WSL on Windows or [UTM](https://mac.getutm.app/) on MacOS.

:::tip Ubuntu on Apple Silicon (ARM64)
Create a VM in UTM using an `arm64` version of Ubuntu. First download the [server edition](https://ubuntu.com/download/server/arm). Then once installed, login and run:
```shell
sudo apt install ubuntu-desktop
```
Then restart the VM.
