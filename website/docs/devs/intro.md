# 👩‍💻 Developer Guide

This guide contains development documentation such as:
- Getting started developing
- Contribution guidance
- Integrating with external sources
- Supporting documentation for integration targets
    - Activity Sources
    - Data Sources

Some of the above is currently aspirational, but content should improve over time.
