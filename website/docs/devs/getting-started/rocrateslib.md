`ROCrates.Net` is a class library written in C# using the .NET Core framework. It aims to provide .NET Core apps with functionality to programmatically build and/or parse [RO-Crates](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/).

Currently it is implemented as a C# port of the Python library [`rocrate`](https://pypi.org/project/rocrate/).
