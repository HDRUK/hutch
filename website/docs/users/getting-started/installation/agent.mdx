# Hutch Agent

<SectionUnderConstruction />

The Hutch Agent is a Python application.

### Local installation

    // TODO

### Cloud

Currently there is no supported "Cloud Native" approach to hosting the Hutch Agent.

However, it is possible to run it on a VM ion the Cloud, or since a Docker image is available, Cloud container services (such as Azure Container Apps) should also work well.

### Docker

Docker images are available [here](https://github.com/hdruk/hutch/pkgs/container/hutch%2Fagent) and can be configured by Environment Variables.

## Network connectivity requirements

It will need outbound connectivity on whatever ports any desired Activity Sources are running on; typically 443 (HTTPS)
