# ➡️ Activity Sources

Activity Sources can be any source of "activity" that Hutch understands in order to execute against one or more configured Data Sources.

Today, the only activity is querying a criteria matching count within the target Data Sources, but in future this could be analytical queries, ML workflows, or any other sort of useful activity against a federated dataset.

## BC|OS (Rquest)

BC|OS is the initially targeted "Activity Source" system for Hutch.
