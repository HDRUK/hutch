# HUTCH

HUTCH is an application that allows federated access to summary statistics of medical data at an institution.

It consists of a Web application (React frontend, .NET backend API, SQL DB) for users to interact with, and Python-based agents which retrieve the data.

# üë©‚Äçüíª Getting Started

## Prerequisites

1. **.NET SDK** `6.x`
  - The backend API is .NET6 (LTS)
1. **Node.js** `>=16.9`
  - `16.9` and newer include **Corepack**
  - `16.x` is LTS at time of writing
1. **Enable [Corepack](https://nodejs.org/api/corepack.html)**
  - Simply run `corepack enable` in your cli
1. PostgreSQL DB
1. RabbitMQ instance

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è
> 
> The provided `docker-compose.yml` provides suitable Postgres and RabbitMQ development instances.

## Database setup

The application stack interacts with a PostgreSQL database, and uses code-first migrations for managing the database schema.

When setting up a new environment, or running a newer version of the codebase if there have been schema changes, you need to run migrations against your database server.

The easiest way is using the dotnet cli:

1. If you haven't already, install the local Entity Framework tooling

- Anywhere in the repo: `dotnet tool restore`

1. Navigate to the same directory as `HutchManager.csproj`
1. Run migrations:

- `dotnet ef database update`
- The above runs against the default local server, using the connection string in `appsettings.Development.json`
- You can specify a connection string with the `--connection "<connection string>"` option

## Working with JavaScript

This monorepo uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) workspaces to manage JS dependencies and scripts.

Basically, where you might normally use `npm` or `yarn`, please use `pnpm` commands instead.

You don't need to install anything special; Corepack will.

A brief [pnpm cheatsheet](#-pnpm-cheatsheet) is provided later in this document.

# üìÅ Repository contents

Areas within this repo include:

- Application Source Code
  - .NET6 backend API
  - React (Vite) frontend client app
  - Python agent
- GitHub Actions
  - workflows for building and deploying the applications
# üí° pnpm cheatsheet

Most pnpm commands can be done recursively against all workspaces with `-r`

You can target a specific workspace by being inside its workspace directory

- or you can target a workspace by relative directory path `-C <dir>`
- or you can filter workspaces to target using `--filter <filter-spec>`
  - See the docs for more complex filtering than just package name

## Dependency management

To install current dependencies for the whole repo: `pnpm i`

> ‚Ñπ
>
> pnpm symlinks `node_modules` inside workspaces.
>
> If you need to clean out `node_modules` you can't just do the root one, so use `pnpm dlx npkill` which will let you delete them all :)

To add a new dependency `pnpm add <package-name>` with `-D` if you want it to be a dev dependency

For information on dependency management in the Python agent, please read the README, [here](app/HutchAgent/README.md).

## Script running

Run scripts with `pnpm <script-name>`

> ‚Ñπ
>
> If the name of the script conflicts with a pnpm command, do `pnpm run <script-name>`

# App Configuration

Notes on configuration values that can be provided, and their defaults.

The app can be configured in any standard way an ASP.NET Core application can. Typically from the Azure Portal (Environment variables) or an `appsettings.json`.
