# üì§üêá Hutch

**Hutch** is part of an application stack for **Federated Activities**, such as Analytics, Data Discovery or Machine Learning.

It is an implementation of the **Executing Agent** module of the TRE-FX stack.

- üîí Make your data discoverable **safely** and **securely**, without directly sharing it.
- ‚úÖ Hutch is being developed for use in Trusted Research Environments (TRE) or Secure Data Environments (SDE).
  - It will enable researchers to run various workflows, such as those on [WorkflowHub](https://workflowhub.eu/) or custom workflows produced by researchers themselves.

The **TRE-FX Federated stack** consists of:
1. A public **Submission Layer** implementation in which projects and users are configured, managed and authorised. This layer receives job requests as TRE-FX 5 Safes RO-Crates.
2. A **TRE Agent** implementation, which interacts with the Submission Layer to receive jobs and validate them in the context of a specific TRE or other secure environment.
3. An **Executing Agent** implementation that accepts jobs from the TRE Agent, executes them and records outputs and provenance, submitting the results to be approved for egress.
  - [WfExS](https://github.com/inab/WfExS-backend) (*Not produced by the Hutch team*).
4. An **Intermediary Store**, where incoming jobs and outgoing results can be held as they are passed between systems for any purpose e.g.
  - queuing approved jobs to be executed.
  - queueing annotated outputs for disclosure checking and egress approval.
  - queueing an approved results package for egress.

**Hutch** is an implementation of `3.` - The **Executing Agent**.
