# üì§üêá Hutch

**Hutch** is an application stack for **Federated Activities**, such as Analytics, Data Discovery or Machine Learning.

- üîí Make your data discoverable **safely** and **securely**, without directly sharing it.
- ‚úÖ Hutch is being developed for use in Trusted Research Environments (TRE) or Secure Data Environments (SDE).
  - It will enable researchers to run various workflows, such as those on [WorkflowHub](https://workflowhub.eu/) or custom workflows produced by researchers themselves.

The stack consists of:
- A submission layer that will be able to receive requests from third-party federated analytics providers as well as directly.
- An Agent that receives queries in the form of RO-Crates and uploads the outputs to a store.
- [WfExS](https://github.com/inab/WfExS-backend) (*Not produced by the Hutch team*).
- A results store, where the results can be held for approval for release by the TRE/SDE.
